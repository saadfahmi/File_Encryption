# File_Encryption

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates **file encryption and decryption**. The project is intended for educational purposes, showcasing basic concepts of working with files and applying encryption algorithms in C programming.

---

## üìù Description

The program performs encryption and decryption on text files. It reads data from an input file, applies an encryption method, and writes the encrypted content to an output file. Similarly, it can reverse the process for decryption.

### Features:
- Read data from a file.
- Encrypt or decrypt data using a simple algorithm.
- Write encrypted/decrypted data to a new file.
### Requirements
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
  
### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saadfahmi/File_Encryption.git
   cd File_Encryption
   code .
   gcc File_Encryption.c
   ./a.exe
